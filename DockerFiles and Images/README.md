# Docker Multi-Stage Build - Homework

**Name:** Tirth Shah
**Roll Number:** 24BCS10347

## Task 1: Multi-Stage Dockerfile

A multi-stage build uses more than one `FROM` stage in a single Dockerfile. An early stage
compiles the application, and the final stage copies only the finished binary into a small
base image. This keeps the final image tiny because the build tools (here, the whole Go
toolchain) are left behind.

### The application (main.go)

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello World from Docker multi-stage build")
 })

 fmt.Println("Server listening on port 8080")
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

### The multi-stage Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# ---- Stage 1: Build ----
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY main.go ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o server main.go

# ---- Stage 2: Run ----
FROM alpine:3.20
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/server ./
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./server"]
```

### Build and run

```bash
docker build -t multistage-app .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name multistage multistage-app
```

### Verify the application

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080
Hello World from Docker multi-stage build
```

### Verify the running container (docker ps)

```bash
$ docker ps
NAMES        IMAGE            STATUS         PORTS
multistage   multistage-app   Up 2 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
```

The application is confirmed running on **port 8080**.

### Result of multi-stage build

The final image is only about **25 MB**, because the Go compiler and source code stay in
the build stage and only the compiled binary is copied into the final Alpine image.

## Task 2: Screenshots

## Task 3: Docker Application Deployment

Three different types of applications were deployed using Docker (see the
`Docker Fundamentals` folder for the full code and Dockerfiles):

| Application | Language / Stack | Port | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | Node.js (http server) | 3000 | Hello World from Node.js! |
| Python | Python (Flask) | 5000 | Hello World from Python (Flask)! |
| Java | Java (HttpServer) | 8080 | Hello World from Java! |

Build and run example (Node.js):

```bash
cd nodejs-app
docker build -t nodejs-app .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 nodejs-app
# open http://localhost:3000
```
